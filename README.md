Implementation of various search algorithms and deep neural networks using TensorFlow.

<h3>-15 puzzle using IDS:</h3>
Given a state in form of a 2D-array array finding its parity to check if goal is reachable or not. If it's reachable we find out the path to the goal state by maintaining a tree and a queue.

<h3>-Image classification using TensorFlow:</h3>
Training a model that can classify images among 26 labels using tensor flow. The model uses various hidden layers to help find the best vector that maximizes accuracy.

<h3>-XOR using gradient descent:</h3>
Using gradient descent in finding the weights of the vector(hypothesis) that gives the maximum accuracy for XOR gate.
